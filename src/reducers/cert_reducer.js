// Implement React-Redux-Firebase to listen for DB changes, this binds the User's unquie DB instance ("ref") to this reducers state.
// Causing the Application (Redux) State to update if there are changes.
// Example: When a certificate is created by the User (POST) then there is no need to call a fetch as this reducer will be listening.

// Placeholder while we figure this shit out
export default function(state = {}, action) {
    return state;
